  abstract  = {We develop an envelope condition method (ECM) for dynamic
               programming problems -- a tractable alternative to expensive
               conventional value function iteration (VFI). ECM has two novel
               features: first, to reduce the cost of iteration on Bellman
               equation, ECM constructs policy functions using envelope
               conditions which are simpler to analyze numerically than
               first-order conditions. Second, to increase the accuracy of
               solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function jointly
               with value function itself. We complement ECM with other
               computational techniques that are suitable for high-dimensional
               problems, such as simulation-based grids, monomial integration
               rules and derivative-free solvers. The resulting value-iterative
               ECM method can accurately solve models with at least up to 20
               state variables and can successfully compete in accuracy and
               speed with state-of-the-art Euler equation methods. We also use
               ECM to solve a challenging default risk model with a kink in
               value and policy functions.},

              contains a sheltered and exposed sector allowing us
              to model wage bargaining between a labor union and
              the exposed sector, reflecting Scandinavian wage
              formation institutions. Wages are subject to a
              downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR). Inspired by
              many countries' fiscal policy responses to the Great
              Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
              investigate the model's ability to generate
              state-dependent fiscal multipliers. We find, that
              both the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates
              and DNWR individually can account for higher fiscal
              multipliers during recessions. In joint presence,
              however, the existence of DNWR reduces the multiplier
              at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly relaxes
              the paradox of toil at the ZLB. We show that the
              state-dependency is robust to alternative assumptions
              about the origin of the recession, the nature of the
              fiscal stimulus and its financing source.},

               when interpolating the next-period value function. As an
               illustrative example, I solve a model with non-durable
               consumption and durable consumption subject to adjustment costs.
               Combining the provided tools, the model is solved almost 50
               times faster than with standard value function iteration for a
               given level of accuracy. Software is provided in both Python and

              households' marginal propensities to consume (MPCs)
              vary with household characteristics and shock size.
              We find that spending peaks in the year of winning
              and gradually reverts to normal within five years.
              Controlling for all items on households' balance
              sheets and characteristics such as education and
              income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets
              that vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity
              winners of the smallest prizes (around US\$1,500) are
              estimated to spend all within the year of winning.
              The corresponding estimate for high-liquidity winners
              of large prizes (US\$8,300–150,000) is slightly
              below one-half. While conventional models will
              struggle to account for such high MPC levels, we show
              that a two-asset life cycle model with a realistic
              earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive can
              account for both the time profile of consumption

                 syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in
                 vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the
                 primary array programming library for the Python language. It
                 has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields
                 as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience,
                 biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance
                 and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an
                 important part of the software stack used in the discovery of
                 gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black
                 hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts
                 lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for
                 organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is
                 the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is
                 constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects,
                 targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed
                 their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to
                 its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts
                 as an interoperability layer between such array computation
                 libraries and, together with its application programming
                 interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the
                 next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

                 a large average marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
                 in heterogeneous agent models? Through a systematic
                 investigation of models with different preferences,
                 dimensions of ex-ante heterogeneity, income processes
                 and asset structure, we show that the most important
                 factor is the share and type of hand-to-mouth
                 households. One-asset models either feature a
                 trade-off between a high average MPC and a realistic
                 level of aggregate wealth, or generate an excessively
                 polarized wealth distribution that vastly understates
                 the wealth held by households in the middle of the
                 distribution. Two-asset models that include both
                 liquid and illiquid assets can resolve this tension
                 with a large enough gap between liquid and illiquid
                 returns. We discuss how such return differential can
                 be justified from the perspective of theory and
                 data.},

               91(3):312--320, 2006) to higher dimensions with more than one
               continuous endogenous state variable. We compare three different
               categories of algorithms: (i) the conventional method with
               exogenous grids (EXOGM), (ii) the pure method of endogenous
               gridpoints (ENDGM) and (iii) a hybrid method (HYBGM). ENDGM
               comes along with Delaunay interpolation on irregular grids.
               Comparison of methods is done by evaluating speed and accuracy
               by using a specific model with two endogenous state variables.
               We find that HYBGM and ENDGM both dominate EXOGM. In an infinite
               horizon model, ENDGM also always dominates HYBGM. In a finite
               horizon model, the choice between HYBGM and ENDGM depends on the
               number of gridpoints in each dimension. With less than 150
               gridpoints in each dimension ENDGM is faster than HYBGM, and
               vice versa. For a standard choice of 25--50 gridpoints in each
               dimension, ENDGM is 1.4--1.7 times faster than HYBGM in the
               finite horizon version and 2.4--2.5 times faster in the infinite

  abstract  = {We present a novel computational framework that can compute
               global solutions to high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic
               models on irregular state space geometries. This framework can
               also resolve value and policy functions' local features and
               perform uncertainty quantification, in a single model
               evaluation. We achieve this by combining Gaussian process
               machine learning with active subspaces; we then embed this into
               a parallelized discrete-time dynamic programming algorithm. To
               demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we compute
               solutions to stochastic optimal growth models of up to 500
               continuous dimensions. We also show that our framework can
               address parameter uncertainty and can provide predictive
               confidence intervals for policies that correspond to the
               epistemic uncertainty induced by limited data. Finally, we
               propose an algorithm that, based on combining this framework
               with Bayesian Gaussian mixture models, is capable of learning
               irregularly shaped ergodic sets as well as performing dynamic
               programming on them.},

  abstract  = {The method of endogenous gridpoints (ENDG) significantly speeds
               up the solution to dynamic stochastic optimization problems with
               continuous state and control variables by avoiding repeated
               computations of expected outcomes while searching for optimal
               policy functions. I provide an interpolation technique for
               non-rectilinear grids that allow ENDG to be used in
               n-dimensional problems in an intuitive and computationally
               efficient way: the acceleration of ENDG with non-linear grid
               interpolation is nearly constant in the density of the grid.
               Further, ENDG has only been shown by example and has never been
               formally characterized. Using a theoretical framework for
               dynamic stochastic optimization problems, I formalize the method
               of endogenous gridpoints and present conditions for the class of
               models for which it can be used.},
