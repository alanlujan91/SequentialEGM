               variables. (Examples of such models are new Keynesian models,
               life-cycle models, heterogeneous-agents models, asset-pricing
               models, multisector models, multicountry models, and climate
               change models.) First, we describe the ingredients that help us
               to reduce the cost of global solution methods. These are
               efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and
               approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and
               $\epsilon$-distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost
               monomial integration formulas, derivative-free solvers, and
               numerically stable regression methods. Second, we discuss
               endogenous grid and envelope condition methods that reduce the
               cost and increase accuracy of value function iteration. Third,
               we show precomputation techniques that construct solution
               manifolds for some models' variables outside the main iterative
               cycle. Fourth, we review techniques that increase the accuracy
               of perturbation methods: a change of variables and a hybrid of
               local and global solutions. Finally, we show examples of
               parallel computation using multiple CPUs and GPUs including

              endogenous grid method (EGM). Standard EGM applied to problems
              with continuous and discrete choices does not by itself generate
              the optimal solution since the first order conditions used to
              generate the endogenous grid are necessary but not sufficient.
              FUES sequentially checks EGM candidate solution points and
              eliminates points not on the upper-envelope of the value
              correspondence by only allowing discontinuities in the policy
              function at non-concave sections of the value correspondence.
              FUES is computationally efficient, involves minimal coding time

              solved using inefficient grid search methods that require many
              evaluations and are slow. This paper provides a novel method for
              solving such models using an extension of the Endogenous Grid
              Method (EGM) that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to
              interpolate functions on unstructured grids. First, I propose an
              intuitive and strategic procedure for decomposing a problem into
              subproblems which allows the use of efficient solution methods.
              Second, using an exogenous grid of post-decision states and
              solving for an endogenous grid of pre-decision states that obey a
              first-order condition greatly speeds up the solution process.
              Third, since the resulting endogenous grid can often be
              non-rectangular at best and unstructured at worst, GPR provides
              an efficient and accurate method for interpolating the value,
              marginal value, and decision functions. Applied sequentially to
              each decision within the problem, the method is able to solve
              heterogeneous agent models with multiple decisions in a fraction
              of the time and with less computational resources than are
              required by standard methods currently used. Software to

               the consumption choice solved separately before the remaining

               global solutions to high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic
               models on irregular state space geometries. This framework can
               also resolve value and policy functions' local features and
               perform uncertainty quantification, in a single model
               evaluation. We achieve this by combining Gaussian process
               machine learning with active subspaces; we then embed this into
               a parallelized discrete-time dynamic programming algorithm. To
               demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we compute
               solutions to stochastic optimal growth models of up to 500
               continuous dimensions. We also show that our framework can
               address parameter uncertainty and can provide predictive
               confidence intervals for policies that correspond to the
               epistemic uncertainty induced by limited data. Finally, we
               propose an algorithm that, based on combining this framework
               with Bayesian Gaussian mixture models, is capable of learning
               irregularly shaped ergodic sets as well as performing dynamic

               gridpoints (ENDGM) introduced by Carroll (Econ Lett
               91(3):312--320, 2006) to higher dimensions with more than one
               continuous endogenous state variable. We compare three different
               categories of algorithms: (i) the conventional method with
               exogenous grids (EXOGM), (ii) the pure method of endogenous
               gridpoints (ENDGM) and (iii) a hybrid method (HYBGM). ENDGM
               comes along with Delaunay interpolation on irregular grids.
               Comparison of methods is done by evaluating speed and accuracy
               by using a specific model with two endogenous state variables.
               We find that HYBGM and ENDGM both dominate EXOGM. In an infinite
               horizon model, ENDGM also always dominates HYBGM. In a finite
               horizon model, the choice between HYBGM and ENDGM depends on the

               gridpoints in each dimension ENDGM is faster than HYBGM, and
               vice versa. For a standard choice of 25--50 gridpoints in each
               dimension, ENDGM is 1.4--1.7 times faster than HYBGM in the

                   an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on
                   Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference
                   uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients

                   simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix
                   multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In
                   addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to
