                  compute solutions for dynamic programming problems with
                  continuous and discrete choices. The FUES method builds on the
                  standard endogenous grid method (EGM). Standard EGM applied to
                  problems with continuous and discrete choices does not by
                  itself generate the optimal solution since the first order
                  conditions used to generate the endogenous grid are necessary
                  but not sufficient. FUES sequentially checks EGM candidate
                  solution points and eliminates points not on the
                  upper-envelope of the value correspondence by only allowing
                  discontinuities in the policy function at non-concave sections
                  of the value correspondence. FUES is computationally
                  efficient, involves minimal coding time or analysis on the
                  researcher side and does not require monotonicity assumptions
                  on the problem. We also show that if the EGM grid size is
                  sufficiently large, FUES is guaranteed to recover the optimal
                  solution without error. FUES can be applied to many standard
                  economic models, involving housing frictions, firm investment
                  frictions, portfolio allocation or labor market participation
                  decisions.},

  abstract     = {Default risk models have been widely employed to assess the
                  ability of households and sovereigns to insure themselves
                  against shocks. Grid search has often been used to solve these
                  models because the complexity of the problem prevents the use
                  of faster but less general methods. In this paper, we propose
                  an extension of the endogenous grid method for default risk
                  models, which is faster and more accurate than grid search. In
                  particular, we find that our solution method leads to a more
                  accurate bond price function, thus making substantial
                  differences in the model’s main predictions. When applied to
                  Arellano’s (2008) model, our approach predicts a standard
                  deviation of the interest rate spread one-third lower and
                  defaults 3 to 5 times less frequently than does the
                  conventional approach. On top of that, our method is
                  efficient. It is approximately 4 to 7 times faster than grid
                  search when applied to a canonical model of Arellano (2008)
                  and 19 to 27 times faster than grid search when applied to the
                  richer model of Nakajima and Rıos-Rull (2014). Finally, we
                  show that our method is applicable to a broad class of default
                  risk models by characterizing sufficient conditions.},

                  choices are typically hard to solve numerically due to the
                  presence of non-convexities. This paper provides a number of
                  tools to speed up the solution of such models. Firstly, I use
                  that many consumption models have a nesting structure implying
                  that the continuation value can be efficiently pre-computed
                  and the consumption choice solved separately before the
                  remaining choices. Secondly, I use that an endogenous grid
                  method extended with an upper envelope step can be used to
                  solve efficiently for the consumption choice. Thirdly, I use
                  that the required pre-computations can be optimized by a novel
                  loop reordering when interpolating the next-period value
                  function. As an illustrative example, I solve a model with
                  non-durable consumption and durable consumption subject to
                  adjustment costs. Combining the provided tools, the model is

                  features: first, to reduce the cost of iteration on Bellman

                  conditions which are simpler to analyze numerically than

                  solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function
                  jointly with value function itself. We complement ECM with
                  other computational techniques that are suitable for
                  high-dimensional problems, such as simulation-based grids,
                  monomial integration rules and derivative-free solvers. The

                  dynamic economic models by casting them into nonlinear
                  regression equations. We derive such equations for three
                  fundamental objects of economic dynamics -- lifetime reward
                  functions, Bellman equations and Euler equations. We estimate
                  the decision functions on simulated data using a stochastic
                  gradient descent method. We introduce an all-in-one
                  integration operator that facilitates approximation of
                  high-dimensional integrals. We use neural networks to perform
                  model reduction and to handle multicollinearity. Our deep
                  learning method is tractable in large-scale problems, e.g.,
                  Krusell and Smith (1998). We provide a TensorFlow code that

                  and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox
                  Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a
                  modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm
                  to derive all terms for training and inference in a single
                  call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP
                  inference from $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2)$. Adapting this algorithm
                  to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply
                  requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication
                  with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a
                  specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up
                  convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses
                  GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP
                  inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we
                  provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP

                  sequential discrete and continuous choice. Unlike existing
                  generalizations, we propose solution algorithm that inherits
                  both advantages of the original method, namely it avoids all
                  root finding operations, and also efficiently deals with
                  restrictions on the continuous decision variable. To further
                  speed up the solution, we perform the inevitable optimization
                  across discrete decisions as more efficient computation of
                  upper envelope of a set of piece-wise linear functions. We
                  formulate the algorithm relying as little as possible on a
                  particular model specification, and precisely define the class
                  of dynamic stochastic optimal control problems it can be

                  discrete sector choice model with consumption-savings

                  comparison to the traditional approach the proposed method
                  runs at least an order of magnitude faster to deliver the same

               efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and
               approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and
               $\epsilon$-distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost monomial

               stable regression methods. Second, we discuss endogenous grid and
               envelope condition methods that reduce the cost and increase

              infinite horizon model, ENDGM also always dominates HYBGM. In a
              finite horizon model, the choice between HYBGM and ENDGM depends
              on the number of gridpoints in each dimension. With less than 150
              gridpoints in each dimension ENDGM is faster than HYBGM, and vice
              versa. For a standard choice of 25 to 50 gridpoints in each
              dimension, ENDGM is 1:4 to 1:7 times faster than HYBGM in the
              finite horizon version and 2:4 to 2:5 times faster in the infinite
              horizon version of the model.},

                  robust, fast and straightforward to implement. Approaches
                  trying to avoid solving the model numerically, therefore, seem
