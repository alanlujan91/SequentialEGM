    abstract = {We develop an envelope condition method (ECM) for dynamic
 programming problems -- a tractable alternative to expensive
 conventional value function iteration (VFI). ECM has two novel
 features: first, to reduce the cost of iteration on Bellman
 equation, ECM constructs policy functions using envelope
 conditions which are simpler to analyze numerically than
 first-order conditions. Second, to increase the accuracy of
 solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function jointly
 with value function itself. We complement ECM with other
 computational techniques that are suitable for high-dimensional
 problems, such as simulation-based grids, monomial integration
 rules and derivative-free solvers. The resulting value-iterative
 ECM method can accurately solve models with at least up to 20
 state variables and can successfully compete in accuracy and
 speed with state-of-the-art Euler equation methods. We also use
 ECM to solve a challenging default risk model with a kink in
 value and policy functions.},

 downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR). Inspired by
 many countries' fiscal policy responses to the Great

 investigate the model's ability to generate
 state-dependent fiscal multipliers. We find, that
 both the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates

 multipliers during recessions. In joint presence,
 however, the existence of DNWR reduces the multiplier
 at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly relaxes
 the paradox of toil at the ZLB. We show that the
 state-dependency is robust to alternative assumptions
 about the origin of the recession, the nature of the
 fiscal stimulus and its financing source.},

 gridpoints (ENDGM) introduced by Carroll (Econ Lett

 continuous endogenous state variable. We compare three different
 categories of algorithms: (i) the conventional method with
 exogenous grids (EXOGM), (ii) the pure method of endogenous

 comes along with Delaunay interpolation on irregular grids.
 Comparison of methods is done by evaluating speed and accuracy
 by using a specific model with two endogenous state variables.
 We find that HYBGM and ENDGM both dominate EXOGM. In an infinite
 horizon model, ENDGM also always dominates HYBGM. In a finite
 horizon model, the choice between HYBGM and ENDGM depends on the
 number of gridpoints in each dimension. With less than 150
 gridpoints in each dimension ENDGM is faster than HYBGM, and
 vice versa. For a standard choice of 25--50 gridpoints in each
 dimension, ENDGM is 1.4--1.7 times faster than HYBGM in the
 finite horizon version and 2.4--2.5 times faster in the infinite

    abstract = {We present a novel computational framework that can compute
 global solutions to high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic
 models on irregular state space geometries. This framework can
 also resolve value and policy functions' local features and
 perform uncertainty quantification, in a single model
 evaluation. We achieve this by combining Gaussian process
 machine learning with active subspaces; we then embed this into
 a parallelized discrete-time dynamic programming algorithm. To
 demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we compute
 solutions to stochastic optimal growth models of up to 500
 continuous dimensions. We also show that our framework can
 address parameter uncertainty and can provide predictive
 confidence intervals for policies that correspond to the
 epistemic uncertainty induced by limited data. Finally, we
 propose an algorithm that, based on combining this framework
 with Bayesian Gaussian mixture models, is capable of learning
 irregularly shaped ergodic sets as well as performing dynamic
 programming on them.},

 up the solution to dynamic stochastic optimization problems with
 continuous state and control variables by avoiding repeated
 computations of expected outcomes while searching for optimal
 policy functions. I provide an interpolation technique for
 non-rectilinear grids that allow ENDG to be used in
 n-dimensional problems in an intuitive and computationally
 efficient way: the acceleration of ENDG with non-linear grid
 interpolation is nearly constant in the density of the grid.
 Further, ENDG has only been shown by example and has never been
 formally characterized. Using a theoretical framework for
 dynamic stochastic optimization problems, I formalize the method
 of endogenous gridpoints and present conditions for the class of
 models for which it can be used.},
